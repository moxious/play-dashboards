Grafana 8.2 also marks the start of our work to bring Grafana closer to all users with a focus on increasing Grafana’s accessibility, part of its continuing mission to democratize metrics for everyone.\n\nThe [plugin catalog](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/plugins/catalog/) is now on by default in Grafana 8.2. Using the plugin catalog you can now find and install official and community plugins without having to leave or restart Grafana. We’ve also updated the time picker to include configurable fiscal quarters. This update makes it easier to use Grafana to produce reports more closely aligned with common review and forecasting cycles.\n\n**While this dashboard only covers new visualization features, Grafana 8.2 includes many additions to alerting, explore, and significant \"under the hood\" improvements.** Checkout the [blog post](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/next/whatsnew/whats-new-in-v8-2/) and our [What's New in Grafana 8.2](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/next/whatsnew/whats-new-in-v8-2/) page for a more complete list of new features. \n\n[Blog post](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/next/whatsnew/whats-new-in-v8-2/) \u0026nbsp; | \u0026nbsp;\n[Download](https://grafana.com/grafana/download) \u0026nbsp; | \u0026nbsp;\n[Grafana Cloud now free with 50gb logs, 10K metric series](https://grafana.com/signup/cloud/connect-account?pg=play\u0026plcmt=whatnew)","mode":"markdown"},"pluginVersion":"9.0.3-0dc0087e","targets":[{"datasource":{"type":"testdata","uid":"9cY0WtPMz"},"refId":"A","target":""}],"transparent":true,"type":"text"},{"datasource":{"type":"graphite","uid":"000000001"},"description":"","gridPos":{"h":15,"w":11,"x":0,"y":9},"id":89,"options":{"content":"\u003cimg src=\"https://grafana.com/static/img/docs/time-range-controls/fiscal_year-8-2.png\" alt=\"drawing\" style=\"object-fit:contain\"/\u003e","mode":"markdown"},"pluginVersion":"9.0.3-0dc0087e","targets":[{"datasource":{"type":"graphite","uid":"000000001"},"refId":"A","target":""}],"type":"text"},{"datasource":{"type":"testdata","uid":"9cY0WtPMz"},"gridPos":{"h":15,"w":13,"x":11,"y":9},"id":59,"links":[],"options":{"content":"## Configurable Fiscal Year in the Time Range Controls\n\nThis dashboard configured with new default time range possibility: **[Previous Fiscal Quarter](https://play.grafana.org/d/k5rL1wH7k/0-new-features-in-v8-2?orgId=1\u0026from=now-1Q%2FfQ)**.\n\nThe biggest change to dashboards in Grafana 8.2 is the inclusion of a configurable fiscal year in the time picker. \n\nThis option enables fiscal quarters as time ranges, which can be helpful for business-focused and executive dashboards in addition to many other common use cases.
